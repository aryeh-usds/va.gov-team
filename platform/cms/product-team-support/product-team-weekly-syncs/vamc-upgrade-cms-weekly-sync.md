### How we work

1. How we work (Kevin)
1. Training - 10 min (Jane)
   1. Report back: 9 trainees. 2 no shows. 
   1. Request Facility info change link and expected turnaround time - https://vaww.va.gov/WEBCOM/VAMC_Facility_Location_Updates.asp
     - This is a question for VHA Digital Media - they make the updates to VAST, how quickly is that processed?
     - They can also contact the VISN administrator, or escalate to VHA Digital Media. 
     - CMS backlog issue to put this in the CMS UI https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/3678 
   1. Should there be a character limit on system banner alerts?
     - This will be coming, but not ready to pull trigger on this. 
1. User administration (Jane) 
- This may be a hot topic for the Spring, governance, data integrity.
1. VHA meeting Dec 9 agenda (Kevin/Jane) - move offline
1. Dual state and product launches - 5 min (Stan)
1. Vaccine content for Facility API (Dave)
 - New taxonomy term coming into VHA health service: "COVID 19 Vaccines" 
 - JHL is adding it, probably to Specialty Care
 - Trying to create a system of record about what facilities are offering one or more of the vaccines. Content will be produced and maintained in Drupal source of truth, available through Lighthouse.
 - Multiple ways to approach this... 
 - What's the data? 
 - Can the current content model support this? Seems like yes. 
 - Push to Lighthouse - we have a similar pattern for facility pushes that we could use, but this would be services. 
 - Need to get the content in? 
 
 
Next steps: Kev and Swirt will meet at 4:30pm to talk through the data and migration problem.
