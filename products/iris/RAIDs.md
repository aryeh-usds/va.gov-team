| RISK CATEGORY | REPORTED ON | IF THIS RISK OCCURS... | THEN THE IMPACT IS   | MITIGATION STRATEGY/COMMENTS | 
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Delivery | 8/14/20 | Go-live strategy not defined and aligned with stakeholders | Code not released to production correctly or in time | Any code in va.gov is deployed daily. TW team will need to coordinate with VSP Engineering team on any feature toggles needed to hide our code and work with stakeholders to align on a MVP timeline. Oracle contract extended to June 2021. TW will need to collaborate with PATS-R team/Stan on go-live strategy |
| Communication | 8/3/20 | TW and PATS-R don't use same tool for async communication | Inter-team communications are delayed and integration points are missed | Schedule inter-team daily/3x week standups? Make use of Monday weekly touch base with Stan/Medha, Thursday weekly call with PATS-R, PIRIS collaboration folder for those with va.gov emails and Teams workspace |
| Communication | 9/17/20 | Attendees list for any call is 20+ | Meeting agenda is less focused and meeting outputs/goals are not reached in time | Reiterate that smaller focused meetings will produce better outputs, for both meetings with Stan's team and business SME meetings |
| Delivery | 12/3/20 | Holiday schedules have multiple team members on extended OOO | No significant work is completed in December to prep for SRA dev team coming on in January. | Stan mentioned that some folks will have extended leaves they need to take in December, so MVP will be validated in the first few weeks of Jan. Is this too late?
| Communication | 12/3/20 | No coordination of shared team ceremonies and collaboration style | Unable to meet delivery timeline | Interteam (TW, PATS-R, SRA) meeting cadence not yet decided. Will this be decided in the next few weeks before holidays? TW team to meet with SRA team week of Dec 7th
| Communication | 12/4/20 | The MVP list is shared and business agreement is sought before any tech feasibility validation by the dev team | Proposed MVP could misrepresent dev team's capabilities within the timeline | Can the MVP list be adjusted once the dev team onboards?
| Delivery | 12/4/20 | Significant development in PATS-R system or Microsoft Dynamics 365 portal | Heavy reliance on manual testing leads to the potential for more bugs. Lack of confidence in the production code without an automated testing suite |
