# Research Plan for Mobile App Usability Testing

December 2020

## What product & team?
VA Mobile App

## Background
The VA Mobile App team has designed and built a MVP mobile app that can be used on iOS and Android devices. We would like to usability test this app to answer the following questions: 
- What usability obstacles exist with sign in?
  - Are participants able to successfuly sign in? If not, what barriers prevent them from doing so?
- What usability obstacles exist in the user navigating the app as a whole?
- What usability obstacles exist to locating and successfully editing personal & contact information?
- (If the participant has appointments data) Can users locate information about an appointment?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear about appointments?
- (If the participant has claims & appeals data) Can users locate information about a specific claim or appeal?
  - What do participants find anything confusing/unclear about claims & appeals?
- What do participants rate the app on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being not useful at all and 5 being extremely useful?
- Do participants feel anything is missing? What?
- If participants could add 1 thing, what would it be? Why?

## Method 
#### What method of research are you planning?
- Remote, 60-minute user interviews with 10 Veterans. We’d like to recruit 10 people, and hope we are able to successfully complete at least 5 sessions.
- Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely via Zoom’s app on the Veteran’s mobile device.  
- We will be asking Veterans to sign into the app using their MHV, DS Logon, or ID.me credentials.  

#### Why this method?
Conducting via Zoom is the only option at the moment. 

#### Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. 

#### What will you be testing?
- We will be testing a live code prototype of a mobile app.
- The mobile app will be unpublished at the time we test it, so participants will need to go through some set up to be able to access the prototype.
- We will provide set up instructions beforehand for both ways, and would like to ask for Perigean’s help in getting participants set up with the app prototype prior to sessions. By doing some pre-session setup, we hope to be able to have enough time to conduct the app testing. 
  - Apple Setup: Use Apple Test Flight app to access prototype (instructions provided seperately) 
  - Android Setup: Load an APK file on their device to access prototype (instructions provided seperately)  

## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to interview a minimum of 5 and maximum of 10 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
- All participants must be Veterans
- All participants must have an active DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account
- All participants must be Level of Assurance (LOA) 3
- All participants must have signed into VA.gov within the last 6 months 
- All participants must be enrolled in VA healthcare
  - If possible to recruit against this, we would like participants with VA medical appointments
- All participants must have an active claim or appeal
- Assistive device users welcome, prototype app works with assistive technology
- Participant pool should be diverse in:
  - Branch of service
  - Gender (30% or more women)
  - Race
  - Age

## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get at least 5 successful sessions (participants show up and are able to successfully sign in and participate), we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation we will have at least a 50% success rate. 

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: TBD (aiming for late January 2021)
2. Length of Sessions: 1 hour
3. Pre-session setup is needed, instructions are [coming soon].
3. Availability: Monday-Friday (11 AM EST – 5 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview in mid-January 2021.
