## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy
The Facilities needs a better understanding of how veterans expect to find health services at VA as a foundational part of improving the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services at VA health care systems.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

### Questions to be answered by research results 
- Where in the VHA service taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as

- Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot

- Flu or influenza

- Coronavirus vs COVID

- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - Time or incident-based (such as Tdap, Tdap Boosters)
  - COVID vaccination
  - COVID testing

## Method

- Treejack sort. This method will allow the participants to easily choose the location(s) within the taxonomy where they expect to find vaccination services information. 
- Using a treejack sort, multiple tasks can be given to account for real-world scenarios (e.g. annual Flu shot, COVID-19 vaccination, etc.)
- **Josh feedback** 
  - Consider creating two tree sorts. One would have a standalone vaccination section in the accordian of Health Services page. The second one would not.
    - The purpose of the first sort with a standalone vaccine section is to determine if Veterans expect to see this in its own place in the heirarchy of Health Services.

## Participants (Preliminary - in Progress)

**Primary Criteria**

- Be a Veteran, active duty service member, reservist, or national guard member.
- Enrolled in VA health care

**Secondary Criteria**

At least:
- 8 participants living in a rural or remote area
- 4 participants that do not have a college degree
- 4 females
- 2 participants of color
- 2 participants 35 or under
- 2 participants 36 - 45
- 2 participants 46 - 55
- 2 participants 56 or over
- 2 participants with cognitive disabilities
- 2 participants living in a major metropolitan area
- 2 participants with a disability rating of 70% or greater
- **Josh feedback - Criteria to consider**
  - Politics: Political leanings play a role in people's opinion of vaccines, particularly wrt COVID-19 vaccination.
  - Do they feel they need a vaccine?
  - Do they regularly get the annual flu shot?
  - Are they being ordered to get the vaccination, or are they curious about getting the vaccination?
  - Josh suggests that with the above criteria, we utilize a **maximum variation sampling**: A sample that is chosen to ensure a wide variety of participants.

## Recruitment Process
- Number of participants who complete the sort should be at least 30 to 50. 
  - Past unmoderated studies have experienced a high abandonment rate, so the number of participants recruited should be double (40), using multiple emails to reach the total number recruited. 
- Researcher will work with Perigean to draft recruitment email and send out an interest email to Veterans
- Veterans respond to the email and receive a link to the sort and code
- After the sort, Veteran provides the code in the questionnaire after the sort
- Send codes to Perigean every few days
- Perigean sends another recruitment email (if needed)
