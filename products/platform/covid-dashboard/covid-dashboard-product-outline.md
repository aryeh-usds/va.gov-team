# Covid Dashboard Product Outline
---

## Overview


## Problem Statement
VA digital health decision makers needs to understand how Veterans are looking for information and benefits during the pandemic so that the VA can best support them during a time of crisis.

How might we design a Covid-19 dashboard so that we can provide relevant data that VA digital health decisions makers need to understand how Veterans are looking for support during the pandemic and condense the dashboard for better readability?

## Hypothesis
If we gather Covid-19 data in one place, we can quickly give VA digital health decision makers the information they need so that they can quickly given Veterans support as National events change rapidly.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- VA health digital decision makers make data-informed decisions to support the VA's pandemic efforts in addition to anecdotal evidence.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users can't use the data because there is
  - Too much data 
  - Undefined data
  - Unupdated data

- Users make decisions based on one data point, without the entire story to back up decisions

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Veterans receive benefits quickly during the pandemic
- The VA is focusing on efforts to support benefits & information that Veterans are looking for

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- The VA is focusing on efforts that don't support Veterans during a time of crisis

## Assumptions
- We can get the data we need from the relevant stakeholders
- We'll have a better understanding of our user goals as time goes by and more Covid-19 information is understood

## Solution Approach

1. Build a quick domo prototype dashboard that can incorporate CSV updates weekly while we wait for BigQuery acquisition.
2. Incorporate all Covid related data to build a database of Covid data for decision-making
3. Clean up the dashboard to point to more relevant information as we learn more
4. Iterate when new pandemic information & events change
