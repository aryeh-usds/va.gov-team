# Customer Service Models [Draft]

## Overview

 A set of plug and play customer support process models that enable VSP to consistently provide high quality support while establishing self-service pathways that work for different types of VFS teams

## Problem Statement

VFS teams find it difficult to understand how best to engage with VSP support resources and where to go to get guidance on platform best practices at different points in their user journey. VSP teams receive customer support requests of widely varying nature and complexity which makes it challenging to provide a consistent support experience to VFS teams.

How might we provide VFS teams with an experience where at every point in their user journey it is clear to them what to expect when requesting support from VSP no matter the nature or complexity of their request?
