### Working with the VFS Analytics Team

- Please share any questions or requests on #vfs-platform-support
- Please add any projected release or launch dates in your requests
- Have an Analytics request? We’ve got a Github issue for that! Please find the appropriate issue and fill that out to get added to our queue:
- As of December 2020, the Analytics team may require more time to complete your analytics requests, so we highly suggest opening issues with us as soon as you have new work so we can add you to our queue sooner. 

### Types of Analytics Team Requests

- Google Tag Manager Implementation Request: To request specific Google Tag Manager implementation during builds.

- KPI Dashboard Request: To request a KPI dashboard creation or iteration on Domo.

- Access Request: To request access to Google Analytics and/or Domo.

- General Analytics Request: A catch all for all other analytics requests (miscellaneous analytics requests), such as:
  - A one-time analytics report. This can be on Domo, on Google Analytics, or an Excel sheet. If it’s on Domo, please add the team’s report as a sub-page to their product KPI dashboard. If they don’t have a KPI dashboard already, please ask them to request one as well or redirect to the Anaytics Product Manager.
  - An analytics meeting. This can be an Analytics orientation, Google Analytics overview, KPI setting workshop, a discussion on GTM work, a discussion on general analytics use, etc.
  - Clarification on reporting. This is if you already have numbers pulled, a report, or are looking at data and want a QA on if they’re reading the data correctly or if the numbers are accurate.
