### What is the Problem to be Solved

Search research indicates that the VA forms page consistently gets high organic search traffic. However it has almost no or very little conversion value. Because this page already gets high organic traffic and has high potential to provide better conversion:

- we want to redesign experience on this page to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- we want to create new content on this page to drive traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications.
- we want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.
